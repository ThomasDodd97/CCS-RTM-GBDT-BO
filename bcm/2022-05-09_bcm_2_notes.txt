This test takes the composition of unaltered basalt in table 1 of:
Liu, D., et al. (2019). "Reactive transport modeling of mineral carbonation in unaltered and altered basalts during CO2 sequestration." International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control 85: 109-120.
this informs the CONDITION basalt and the MINERALS blocks.
temperature (oC); specified as for background water (table 1).
Aqueous species type, concentration; specified in CONDITION basalt block as for background water (table 2) Concentration of Fe++ and Fe+++ split equally.
Mineral type, Initial volume fraction (dec. %), Specific surface area (m^2 g^-1); specified in CONDITION basalt block as for flood basalt (table 1).

An arbitrarily sized brick of basalt was set to 1*1*1 cm in the DISCRETIZATION block.
The INITIAL_CONDITIONS block is set to the only block discretized with the basalt CONDITION block referenced i.e. basalt 1 1 1

By cross referencing between the minerals specified above and the databases dissolution reations for all these primary minerals
we can find which primary species are evolved and need placing in the PRIMARY_SPECIES block.
NOTE although not noted in the above reactions, we add Fe+++ because we know its there: it goes in the SECONDARY_SPECIES block, otherwise we get errors
NOTE that H2O is assumed to be a part of the primary species and doesn't therefore need specifying.

A sweep test i.e. database_sweep is set to true in the RUNTIME block, and the block of basalt simulated.
After running, the basalt.out file is examined: of interest is the "concentrations of individual species, exchangers, and surface complexes"
Here, we should note that any species with a log molality above -12 (i.e. a pred conc above 10E-12) should be added to the
secondary species section in the next model when we turn off the sweep function off.

NOTE Mineral kinetics in the .dbs need fixing they are currently placeholder values

This test now incorporates the secondary species identified in the first sweep based model.

This test aims to incorporate secondary mineralogy.

This test aims to incorporate kinetics of minerals specified.

By assuming an initial porosity of 30% in the basalt (in line with the paper from earlier) we need to adapt the
minerals' volume fractions!

Q: Attempted to add the secondary minerals, but don't know where/what to specify...?
    e.g. should I incorporate those from the sweep or those from reading...
A: Later we'll have a further think; mg based data- tracks authigenic (in-place) clays
    Add any secondaries from the paper to the mineral section

Q: I had to remove Fe+++ again from the primary components because it through errors when runnin
    i.e. the error was to do with Fe+++ not being involved in any reactions...
    Further to this, Fe+++ isn't specified for H2O concentrations in the paper, just Fe as a whole- help?
A: It seems the system is anoxic, don't place iron+++ in yet- no iron+++ used in any of the reactions

Q: Attempted to add kinetics to the database, but need help specifying and then calling these...
    Further to this, alkaline how to specify dependence, it has a different metric...
    How does !cis and (kcal/mole) effect the kinetic blocks in .dbs?
    When I specify both the labels normal and acid, it says that 14 minerals are in use instead of 7...
A: Linking methodology taught.

Q: Should the porosity block be set up as such- or does it automatically work out pore vol etc
A: Yes, that is fine.

Q: By specifying charge over Na+ I have removed its concentration- should this be of concern?
A: No, such small balancing concentrations have little effect on overall sys.

Q: I specified temperature in the basalt condition block- is this correct?
A: Yes, that is fine.

This model incorporates fixes from Fridays work with Angus.
i.e.
    Fixed the linking between database and minerals.
    Added all the secondary minerals recognised in the paper.
    Ran to a couple 1000 years until a pseudo steady state was reached.

Having had a chat with Angus we found that the rates for the various minerals were all too high.
These rates were derived from the Liu paper- which is modelling a basalt at much greater pressures than we are concerned with for a box model.
Things were dissolving all too fast to be realistic.
We therefore reduced the rates within the .in file, overriding the rates I had set inside the .dbs file.

We managed to get these rates to a point where we were happy, but a new problem materialised- all the carbonate minerals were undersaturated.
No matter how much inorganic carbon was added (HCO3-) to the mix, the calcite refused to go from undersaturated to oversaturated in the model.
We think that due to the extremely high pH, all the HCO3- is immediately turned into CO3-- and H+ to try to counteract this proton deficiency
this therefore disallows the oversaturation of calcite as calcite precipitation is dependent upon the presence of HCO3-.

Adaptations made:
    1) We altered the time period investigated by altering the spatial_profile in the OUTPUT block.
    2) We altered the rates directly by specifying a -rate next to mineral names in the MINERALS block.
    3) We altered the composition of the fluid in the basalt CONDITION block.
    4) We altered the time stepping by changing timestep_max in the RUNTIME block.

I will therefore investigate the extremely high pH mentioned in the paper as well as the specified Keq values specified in the .dbs file.

Looked at the paper again and realized that we had been attempting to run the model
at a high pH for a high amount of DIC- this was erroneous!
Altered the fluid composition and ran the model again to try to identify what
is going on

Having spent the morning working together with Angus, we found that the paper we were working on
uses pressures higher than we have assumed so far.
To simulate pressures similar to that within their paper we need to adapt any parameters that
are changed by pressure- crunchtope cant adapt in the same way it does with temperature- we need to
specify new.

Respecified the log k values- 300 oC are wrong though...

Myself and Angus found a website which the Liu paper seemingly obtained its log k values for basaltic minerals
under pressure. The website is located at: https://models.earth.indiana.edu/supcrtbl.php

Another website that proved extremely helpful was the thermoddem page: https://thermoddem.brgm.fr/

Here, we specified the minerals being investigated and the conditions they were being subjected to;
in this case we used the reservoir temperature and pressures specified in the liu paper, which were
35oC and 5.2MPa (52bar). 

Once the log K files were downloaded we transcribed the values into their respective positions in the
crunchtope database file. Due to a lack of data on SUPCRTBL about K-Feldspar we had to substitute 
microcline into its place, which is reasonable as it is the low temperature end member of the
plagioclase group that fits the bill.

By the end of the 2022-05-20 we had a model that was behaving a lot like the Liu papers model of 
flow basalt with injection water passing into it. I have therefore decided to initiate a new test series
which will seek to implement the flow basalt, mixed basalt, and the serpentinized basalts separately, in
a bid to emulate the liu model across the board...
